--notes: 
Might be able to replicate data extraction code to get data for updated 2019-2021, and also get the blossoming data as well. 
See https://www.data.jma.go.jp/sakura/data/index.html for main source (**They also have data for other plants**); https://www.data.jma.go.jp/sakura/data/pdf/004.pdf for blooming data; https://www.data.jma.go.jp/sakura/data/pdf/005.pdf for full flowering data
There's also data on the github that includes weather data, but needs more investigation on what the columns mean

**Note that according to this Japanese website: https://sakura.weathermap.jp/en.php, 
"First bloom" means observation trees have 5 to 6 flowers that have bloomed.
"Full bloom" means 80% of the observation tree flowers have bloomed.
